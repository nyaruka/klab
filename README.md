## kLab Website

This is the public repository for the kLab website hosted at: http://klab.rw

Although Nyaruka originally created the website we look forward to having contributions from the Kigali community to enhance it over time.  Just use the normal Github fork/pull request process in order to submit patches.

Before embarking on major changes please file a new Issue with your planned enhancement so we can discuss whether it is appropriate.

Thanks.

## Getting Started

These instructions are for Unix/OS X, you will have to modify these a bit to get going on Windows.  Consult your favorite Windows Python guru for details.

#### 1. Check out the repository:

```
  % git clone git://github.com/nyaruka/klab.git
  % cd klab
```

  % curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  % poetry shell
```

#### 3. Initialize it with all the required libraries:

```   
  % poetry install --no-root
```

#### 4. Symlink your dev settings file:

```
  % cd klab
  % ln -s settings.py.dev settings.py
  % cd ..
```

#### 5. Initialize our database:

```
  % python manage.py migrate
